This, coupled with enhanced emergency response capabilities, such as drills and training for first responders, ensures a rapid and effective response during seismic events.Critical infrastructure, including hospitals, schools, and transportation networks, should undergo regular seismic vulnerability assessments. Identifying potential vulnerabilities and implementing mitigation measures enhances the resilience of key infrastructure components.
