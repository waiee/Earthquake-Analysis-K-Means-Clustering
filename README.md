# Earthquake-Analysis-K-Means-Clustering 📊🔍

In this project, I aimed to identify patterns in earthquake occurrences over time and uncover areas with a high risk of earthquake occurrence. By leveraging the power of data analysis and data mining method, I conducted a comprehensive study to enhance disaster preparedness and minimize the impact of earthquakes on society.

Using the K-Means clustering algorithm, I analyzed earthquake datasets and successfully identified distinct clusters based on their geographical and temporal characteristics. This allowed me to gain valuable insights into the spatial distribution and temporal patterns of earthquakes, enabling us to understand how they evolve over time.

Also, I've hosted the project on Streamlit, providing an interactive and user-friendly platform to explore the results.

By making these findings accessible, I hope to contribute to the field of earthquake research and support authorities in their efforts to implement effective disaster preparedness and risk management measures. 📈
